Key Features of Nmap
Nmap is a powerful tool with a variety of features designed for network discovery, analysis, and security assessment. Here are its key features:
1. Network Discovery
  Identifies active hosts within a network.
  Maps the network topology, uncovering relationships between devices.
2. Port Scanning
  Scans for open, closed, or filtered ports on target systems.
  Supports scanning individual ports, specific port ranges, or all 65,535 ports.
3. Service Version Detection
  Determines the type and version of services running on open ports.
  Helps identify vulnerabilities associated with outdated services.
4. Operating System Detection
  Detects the operating system of target devices, including version details and hardware information.
  Useful for profiling target systems during penetration testing.
5. Scripting Engine (NSE) Executes custom or built-in scripts to perform advanced tasks such as:
  Vulnerability detection.
  Malware identification.
  Service enumeration.
  Network policy compliance checks.
  Includes pre-built scripts for specific use cases, such as identifying CVEs or SQL injection.
6. Aggressive Scanning
  Combines service version detection, OS detection, and traceroute in a single scan to gather comprehensive data about a target.
7. Output Customization Generates reports in multiple formats:
  Normal (-oN), XML (-oX), and grepable (-oG) formats.
  Supports saving outputs for later analysis or integration with other tools.
8. Flexible Scanning Techniques Offers a variety of scan modes to suit different needs:
  SYN Scan (-sS): Stealthy and efficient.
  TCP Connect Scan (-sT): Establishes a full TCP connection.
  UDP Scan (-sU): Explores open UDP ports.
  Ping Scan (-sP): Detects live hosts without performing port scans.
9. IPv6 Support configurations.
  Fully supports IPv6 scanning to accommodate modern network
10. Speed and Timing Control Adjustable scanning speed to balance efficiency and stealth.
  -T4 for fast scans.
  -T0 for highly stealthy scans.
11. Traceroute Maps the path packets take to reach the target.
  Identifies intermediate devices and networks in the route.
12. Vulnerability Assessment Leverages NSE scripts to detect specific vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, such as:
  SQL injection.
  Weak SSL/TLS ciphers.
  Open SMB shares.
13. Advanced Packet Manipulation Customizes packet data, length, and checksum to evade detection or tailor scans for specific targets.
14. Security and Privacy Testing Detects web application vulnerabilities, HTTP headers, and SSL certificate issues.
  Performs brute-forcing and checks for anonymous login possibilities in FTP or
SMB protocols.
