1. Network Discovery
  Identifies active hosts within a network.
  Maps the network topology, uncovering relationships between devices.

2. Port Scanning
  Scans for open, closed, or filtered ports on target systems.
  Supports scanning individual ports, specific port ranges, or all 65,535 ports.

3. Service Version Detection
  Determines the type and version of services running on open ports.
  Helps identify vulnerabilities associated with outdated services.

4. Operating System Detection
  Detects the operating system of target devices, including version details and hardware information.
  Useful for profiling target systems during penetration testing.

5. Scripting Engine (NSE) Executes custom or built-in scripts to perform advanced tasks such as:
  Vulnerability detection.
  Malware identification.
  Service enumeration.
  Network policy compliance checks.
  Includes pre-built scripts for specific use cases, such as identifying CVEs or SQL injection.

6. Aggressive Scanning
  Combines service version detection, OS detection, and traceroute in a single scan to gather comprehensive data about a target.

7. Output Customization Generates reports in multiple formats:
  Normal (-oN), XML (-oX), and grepable (-oG) formats.
  Supports saving outputs for later analysis or integration with other tools.

8. Flexible Scanning Techniques Offers a variety of scan modes to suit different needs:
  SYN Scan (-sS): Stealthy and efficient.
  TCP Connect Scan (-sT): Establishes a full TCP connection.
  UDP Scan (-sU): Explores open UDP ports.
  Ping Scan (-sP): Detects live hosts without performing port scans.

9. IPv6 Support configurations.
  Fully supports IPv6 scanning to accommodate modern network

10. Speed and Timing Control Adjustable scanning speed to balance efficiency and stealth.
  -T4 for fast scans.
  -T0 for highly stealthy scans.

11. Traceroute 
  Maps the path packets take to reach the target.
  Identifies intermediate devices and networks in the route.

12. Vulnerability Assessment Leverages NSE scripts to detect specific vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, such as:
  SQL injection.
  Weak SSL/TLS ciphers.
  Open SMB shares.

13. Advanced Packet Manipulation 
  Customizes packet data, length, and checksum to evade detection or tailor scans for specific targets.

14. Security and Privacy Testing 
  Detects web application vulnerabilities, HTTP headers, and SSL certificate issues.
  Performs brute-forcing and checks for anonymous login possibilities in FTP or SMB protocols.

NMAP Commands
Basic Scanning Flags
  -sS (TCP SYN Scan)  :  Performs a stealth scan by sending SYN packets and waiting for responses, Sends packets one at a time.
      -S --> Hping3
  -sT (TCP Connect Scan)  :  Completes the full TCP handshake; used when SYN scan isn’t possible.
  -sU (UDP Scan)  :  Scans for open UDP ports.
      --udp --> Hping3
  -sP (Ping Scan)  :  Checks if hosts are up without scanning for open ports.
  -sV (Service Version Detection)  :  Detects the service and version running on open ports.
  --reason  :  Displays the reason for a port being open or closed.
  --open  :  Only shows open ports in the scan results.

OS Detection
  -O (Operating System Detection)  :  Attempts to determine the operating system of the target.
  --osscan-guess  :  Makes an educated guess if OS detection results are inconclusive.

Port Scanning
  -p (Port Specification)  :  Scans specific ports or a range of ports.
  -p- (All Ports)  :  Scans all 65,535 ports.

Aggressive Scanning
  -A (Aggressive Scan)  :  Combines OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
  --script vuln  :  vulnerability detection scripts.
  --script http-* -p 80,443  : Checks HTTP vulnerabilities.

Evading Firewalls and IDS
  -f (Fragment Packets)  :  Sends fragmented packets to evade packet inspection.
  -D (Decoy Scan)  :  Masks your real IP address by spoofing decoys.
  --randomize-hosts -T3 : Randomizes scan order to avoid detection.
  --source-port  :  Spoofs the source port to bypass firewalls.
  --script  :  Specifies a custom or specific script from the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE).

Hping3
hping3 can generate high-speed packet floods (useful for DoS testing). --> --flood
Send raw IP packets with no TCP/UDP/ICMP headers. --> --raw -d x (X size of raw data)
