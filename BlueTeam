  Automate security processes.
  Patch vulnerabilities in systems and applications.
    Example Task: Setting up a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to prevent SQL Injection attacks.

5.Security Auditor / Compliance Analyst
  Role: Ensures security policies and regulations are followed.
  Responsibilities:

How SIEM Works (Step-by-Step)

1️⃣ Log Collection – Collects logs from firewalls, IDS/IPS, servers, applications.
2️⃣ Normalization – Converts logs into a standardized format.
3️⃣ Correlation & Analysis – Uses AI & rule-based detection to find anomalies.
4️⃣ Alerting & Incident Response – Sends alerts when threats are detected.
5️⃣ Reporting & Compliance – Generates security reports for compliance (ISO 27001, GDPR, PCI-DSS).

Credential & Access Logs:
C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM - Stores local password hashes (target for credential dumping attacks).
C:\Windows\repair\SAM - Backup of user credentials (potential target for attackers).
C:\Windows\System32\config\SECURITY - Holds security policies & access control settings.

System & Event Logs:
C:\Windows\System32\winevt - Stores Windows Event Logs (crucial for SIEM correlation).
C:\Windows\SYSTEM - Tracks system-wide changes and
C:\Windows\System32\config\SOFTWARE - Registry hive with details on installed software and changes.

Malware & Threat Hunting Indicators:
C:\Windows\Prefetch - Tracks recently executed programs (useful for forensic timelines).
C:\Windows\AppCompat\Programs\Amcache.hve - Logs details of executed applications, great for detecting lateral movement.
C:Users\*\NTUSER.dat - Holds user-specific registry settings, often abused for persistence.

Persistence & Startup Investigations:
C:\Users\*\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start\Menu\Programs\Startup - User-specific persistence mechanisms.
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup - Global startup folder for all users (often misused by malware).
