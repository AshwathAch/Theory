How SIEM Works (Step-by-Step)

1️⃣ Log Collection – Collects logs from firewalls, IDS/IPS, servers, applications.
2️⃣ Normalization – Converts logs into a standardized format.
3️⃣ Correlation & Analysis – Uses AI & rule-based detection to find anomalies.
4️⃣ Alerting & Incident Response – Sends alerts when threats are detected.
5️⃣ Reporting & Compliance – Generates security reports for compliance (ISO 27001, GDPR, PCI-DSS).
