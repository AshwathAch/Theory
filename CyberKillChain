    Block Physical Deliveries - Disable autorun for removable drives - CrowdStrike, or Carbon Black.

4. Exploitation  --> The payload exploits a vulnerability to execute the attack
    Web Exploitation Tools - SqLmap, Burpsuite, OWASP ZAP.
    Privilege Escalation Tools - Winpeas, Linpeas, PowerSlpoit.
    Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities - DirtyPipe, EternalBlue.
    Exploitation of Misconfigurations - Responder, Impacket.
    Wireless Exploitation - Aircrack-ng, Wifite.
  Defensive Actions  :
    Regularly Patch Vulnerabilities - Automate patch management - WSUS, Ansible, or SCCM.
    Harden Systems Against Exploitation - Lynis: Hardens Linux systems, CIS Benchmarks.
    Monitor for Exploitation Attempts - Use intrusion detection/prevention systems - Snort, OSSEC.
    Detect and Prevent Privilege Escalation - Sysmon: Detects privilege escalation, CrowdStrike Falcon, Carbon Black.
    Protect Web Applications - ModSecurity, Cloudflare WAF.

5. Installation --> Installs malware or a backdoor on the compromised system.
    Remote Access Tools (RATs) - njRAT, Quasar RAT, DarkComet.
    Persistence Tools - PowerSploit, Empire.
    Advanced Payload Installation - Cymothoa.
  Defensive Actions  :
    Detect and Block Malicious Files - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, CrowdStrike Falcon, or Carbon Black, Tripwire.

    Detect and Remove Web Shells - ModSecurity: Detects and blocks malicious uploads, ClamAV.
    Prevent Remote Access Tools - Suricata : Detects RAT communication patterns.
    Audit Scheduled Tasks and Services 

6. Command and Control (C2) --> The compromised system establishes communication with the attackerâ€™s C2 server to receive instructions or exfiltrate data.
    C2 Frameworks - Metasploit, Silver, Cobalt, Empire.
    RATs (Remote Access Trojans) - njRAT, Quasar RAT, DarkComet.
    Web-Based C2 Tools - PowerShell Web Delivery.
