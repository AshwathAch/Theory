Filter by IP Address --> ip.addr == 192.168.1.10
Filter by Protocol --> http, tcp, udp, dns, icmp
Filter by Port --> tcp.port == 80  # HTTP traffic, udp.port == 53  # DNS queries, tcp.port == 22  # SSH traffic
Filter by MAC Address --> eth.addr == 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E
Filter by Malicious Traffic --> 
  http.request.method == "POST"
  dns.qry.name contains "malware.com"
  tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0
Detecting a SYN Flood Attack --> tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0
Extracting Passwords from HTTP --> http contains "password="
Follow TCP/UDP Streams (Reconstruct Conversations)
Extract Transferred Files from Network Traffic --> File → Export Objects → HTTP/FTP/SMB. (Save files foe malware analysis).
Detect ARP Spoofing (MITM Attack) --> arp.duplicate-address-detected

Common anomalies:
Port Scanning or Reconnaissance  -->  Frequent SYN packets (SYN scan), ICMP Echo Requests (Ping scans)
High Frequency DNS Requests
Large Amounts of Traffic from One IP
Unusual Protocols --> Telnet, FTP
ARP Spoofing/Poisoning  -->  Inconsistent MAC Addresses
Session Hijacking  -->  Unexpected TCP Resets (RST), Unusual Sequence Numbers
Malicious Payloads in HTTP or FTP Traffic  -->  Suspicious HTTP Requests/Responses, File Transfers Over FTP.
Beaconing and C2 (Command and Control) Communication  -->  Regular Patterns in Traffic:
Traffic to VPN Servers
