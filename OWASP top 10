Broken Access Control
  Description:
  Occurs when restrictions on authenticated users are not properly enforced.
  Mitigation:
  Implement role-based access controls (RBAC).
  Deny access by default; only permit necessary actions.
  Regularly test access controls to ensure proper enforcement.
  Eg  : Normal user enables himself with admin privileges. 

Cryptographic Failures
  Description: 
  This involves improper protection of sensitive information through weak cryptography.
  Mitigation:
  Use strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms.
  Ensure data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.
  Avoid using deprecated or weak cryptographic protocols.
  Eg  :  storeing passwords in plain text

Injection
  Description: 
  Happens when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query, leading to unintended execution.
  Mitigation:
  Use parameterized queries and prepared statements.
  Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
  Employ input validation libraries or frameworks.
  Eg  :  ' OR '1'='1

Insecure Design
  Description:
  Refers to flaws in the application's design that lead to security vulnerabilities.
  Mitigation:
  Incorporate threat modeling during the design phase.
  Adopt secure design patterns and principles.
  Conduct regular security reviews of the application's architecture.
  Eg  : Application without autentication

Security Misconfiguration
  Description: 
  Arises from improper configuration of security settings in applications, servers, or databases.
  Mitigation:
  Implement a repeatable hardening process for deployments.
  Disable unnecessary features and services.
  Regularly update and patch systems and applications.
  Eg  :  default admin username and password.

Vulnerable and Outdated Components
  Description: 
  Using components with known vulnerabilities can compromise application security.
  Mitigation:
  Maintain an inventory of all components and their versions.
  Regularly update components to their latest versions.
  Monitor for and address any reported vulnerabilities in components.
  Eg  :  A website uses an outdated version of Apache

Identification and Authentication Failures
  Description: 
  Weaknesses in authentication mechanisms can allow attackers to compromise user identities.
  Mitigation:
  Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA).
  Implement secure password policies and storage mechanisms.
  Invalidate session tokens upon logout or inactivity.
  Eg  :   weak passwords like 123456 or password

Software and Data Integrity Failures
  Description:
  Occurs when software updates, critical data, or CI/CD pipelines are not protected against integrity violations.
  Mitigation:
  Use digital signatures to verify the integrity of software and data.
  Implement controls to prevent unauthorized access to CI/CD pipelines.
  Regularly back up critical data and verify its integrity.
  Eg  :  application downloads updates from an unverified source.

Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
  Description: 
  Inadequate logging and monitoring can delay the detection of security breaches.
  Mitigation:
  Ensure all security-relevant events are logged.
  Regularly review and analyze logs for suspicious activities.
  Establish an incident response plan for detected security events.
  Eg  :  does not log failed login attempts, the attack goes undetected.

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  Description: 
  Occurs when an application fetches a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL.
  Mitigation:
  Sanitize and validate all user inputs used in URL requests.
  Implement network segmentation to limit internal resource access.
  Disable unnecessary URL fetching capabilities in the application.
